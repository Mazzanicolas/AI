# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x)) and the single output variable (![y](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y)). When there is a single input variable (![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x)), the method is referred to as **Simple Linear Regression**. When there are multiple input variables, this method is referred as **Multiple Linear Regression**

## Model Representation

Linear regression is a simple equation that takes **only** numeric values.

## Pros vs Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simple | Can only handle numeric values |
| | Input data needs a linear relationship |
